# System-Level Text-to-Speech Service Design

## Summary

## Definition of Done

A Windows service with tray icon that speaks text aloud using Piper TTS with configurable ONNX voice models. The service accepts text via three input modes: (1) an HTTP POST endpoint for programmatic use by apps like T-Tracker, with per-source voice and filter rules; (2) global hotkeys that read selected text with a preconfigured voice; and (3) global hotkeys that read selected text after presenting a voice picker popup. Voice models are swapped via config files — no recompilation. The project ships with pre-built Piper voices and documents the external workflow for importing custom-trained ONNX models.

**Success criteria:**
- Service runs as Windows service with system tray presence
- HTTP endpoint accepts text, applies per-source voice/filter config, and speaks
- Global hotkeys capture selected text (via clipboard) and speak with configured or user-selected voice
- Voice models load from a `voices/` directory based on config — adding a new voice requires only dropping in an ONNX file and updating config
- T-Tracker sends notification text to the service as the first integration

**Out of scope for v1:**
- Custom voice model training pipeline (documented externally only)
- Clipboard monitor mode (passive speak-on-copy)
- Windows notification listener interception
